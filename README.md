# What is Azure Function App
- Is a service where we can host functions in Azure as service code
- The service code is used to interact with Azure services
- Similar to giving access to an application to access a storage account, we can use a Managed identity by enabling it for the Azure Function app and then give access for the Managed identity onto the storage account
